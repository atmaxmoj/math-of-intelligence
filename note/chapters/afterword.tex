\chapter*{Afterword}

We began with logic, passed through coalgebra and semirings, and arrived at the limits of intelligence.

The journey reveals a unity: \textbf{expression, learning, and limits are all algebraic}. The same structures---functors, fixed points, descent in well-founded orders---appear at every level.

Much remains unknown. The main conjecture (syntax-semantics optimality) is unproven. The existence of universal learners is unclear. The boundary between computable and incomputable intelligence is sharp, but its exact location is undetermined.

These are questions for the future.
