\chapter*{Preface}

What is intelligence? This book approaches the question mathematically.

We take a specific stance: \textbf{intelligence is the ability to learn and then act}. This suggests a natural decomposition:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Expression}: What can be described? What structures exist?
    \item \textbf{Learning}: How do we find the right structure from data?
    \item \textbf{Learning well}: Why are some structures easier to learn than others?
    \item \textbf{Limits}: How far can intelligence go?
\end{enumerate}

The mathematics we develop unifies modal logic, coalgebra, semirings, and optimization theory.

The central question of this book:

\textit{Given what we want to express (semantics), what is the best way to parameterize it (syntax) for learning?}
\end{quote}
