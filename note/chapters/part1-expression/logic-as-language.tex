\chapter{Logic as Language}

\begin{goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item See the evolution of expressive power: from syllogisms to modal logic
    \item Understand why studying invariance leads naturally to category theory
    \item Meet algebra and coalgebra as the two faces of formal structure
\end{itemize}
\end{goals}

In the previous chapter, we saw that logic studies \textbf{form} and \textbf{invariance}---what properties are preserved under what transformations. Now we trace how this insight developed, and where it leads.
