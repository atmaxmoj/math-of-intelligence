% Section: Topos Theory: Logic and Geometry Unite

Lawvere and Myles Tierney developed \textbf{topos theory}: categories that behave like the category of sets, but with an internal logic that can differ from classical logic.

\begin{intuition}
A topos is a ``universe of mathematics'' with its own internal logic. Different toposes can have different logics: classical, intuitionistic, or even more exotic.

This unified logic and geometry: a topos is both a geometric object (like a space) and a logical universe (where you can do mathematics).
\end{intuition}
